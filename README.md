## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install a user script manager**  
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Recommended)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (Open-source)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (for Firefox)

2. **Install a script**  
   - Visit the raw `.user.js` file in this repository, copy it whole;
   - On TamperMonkey, click `Create a new script`, paste it and save it;


## 📚 wiki-anchor-enhancer.user.js

Although the script is set to be active on [The Wiki Game Daily](https://www.thewikigamedaily.com/) and [The Wiki Game](https://www.thewikigame.com/]), it is possible to enable these heinous colors elsewhere.

On TamperMonkey for example, on the scripts settings, you could add your own `includes` url matches, such as `https://*wikipedia.org/*` for wikipedia or just `*` for everything!

You can also pick your own colors on line 28 and 29.
